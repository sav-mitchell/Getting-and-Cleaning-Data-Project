# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

## Run_Analysis Code
The Run_Analysis code performs and allows the following analysis:
  1. Downloading the data table and dplyr packages necessary for the Run_Analysis
  code. 
  2. Reading the files' metadata and the test and training data.
  3. Merging the test and training data together.
  4. Extracting the mean and standard deviations values from the merged dataset.
  5. Renaming the merged dataset's variable needs to be more descripitive for 
  the audience.
  6. Creating a new final tidy dataset. 

## Final Product
The IndependentTidyData.txt is the final product from the Run_Analysis code.
